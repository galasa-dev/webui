# .env - This file outlines the environment variables that the webui uses.
# Important: Do NOT enter any sensitive information like auth tokens into this file.
# Instead, create a copy of this file with .local suffixed to it (e.g. .env.development.local)
# and edit that file however you wish as it will be ignored by git.
# See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/environment-variables for more details as to how Next.js loads environment variables.
